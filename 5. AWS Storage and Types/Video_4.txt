AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration and Versioning

AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration
- Imagine the region that is selected is N.Virginia. So the data is first transfered t Nearest Edge location through Internet
- Later it is transferred from edge location to the region via the backbone that is connected through every edge location and region
- This adds additional cost

AWS S3 verioning:
- Works similar to Git versioning.
- Versioning in Amazon S3 is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.
- You can use the S3 Versioning feature to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets.
- This is also a paid option

AWS S3 Life Cycle:
- Can define Life cycle policy to decide when data and its versions needs to move to different storage classes
- We can expire the data, mentioning after few days, I want to delete the data

Note: Whenever there is data larger than 5GB, upload it in multipart. 
    - From AWS console, we can't upload multipart upload
    - Can be done only using AWS CLI, AWS SDKs
