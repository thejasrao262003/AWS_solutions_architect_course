AWS Organization and Service Control Policy

AWS Organization:
    - A company/organization has a single AWS account. This is shared by various teams like dev, testing, security etc
    - Now when the bill arrives, it is very hard to find which team spent how much
    - If company starts taking multiple accounts for different teams, it is very hard to Management.
    Example: Each bill might be generated on different dates, or if you have 10 accounts, then 10 different bills
    - If the company wants to apply a policy that no account will be able to create a server above T2 micro. Now they need to set this condition in each and every account.

    - So AWS Organization manages multiple account centrally. We get consolidated billing
    - It allows to apply policies centrally

    - So the main account becomes root/management account
    - Under root account, you have multiple organisational units.
    - Under OU you have either sub OU or accounts.

Service Control Policy:
    - When you apply policy on AWS Organization, it's called SCP.
    - The policies set on root account, will be propogated to each account in every OU and sub OU
    Example: If root account decides, you cannot create an EC2 instance bigger than T2 micro, then the children accounts can't create better servers.
    SCP again acts as a filter not as a granter
