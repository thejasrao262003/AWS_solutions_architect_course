AWS Identity and Access Management

Permission Boundary:
    - A permissions boundary in AWS IAM is an advanced feature that sets the maximum permissions an IAM user or role can have, regardless of what their IAM policy allows.
    Example: Suppose
        - A user has an IAM policy that allows s3:* (all S3 actions)
        - But a permissions boundary allows only s3:GetObject
        - Result: The user can only perform s3:GetObject, even though the IAM policy allows more.

Note: This can only restrict IAM users, can't give permissions.
