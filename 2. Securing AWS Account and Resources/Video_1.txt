Securing AWS Accounts and Resources

1. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- This file focuses on Root Account, User, Groups and Roles

AWS Root account: AWS account owner
IAM user: Different users under root account
Example: Root user is company account, the employees will have IAM Accounts

- IAM users are users who can access an AWS account.
    - Each IAM user has his own AWS credentials (user id or access key id)
    - Each users are authorised to perform specific AWS actions based on permissions assigned to them.

- IAM Groups
    - In case multiple user fall under same permission, it is recommended to create IAM group
    - Assign IAM users to an IAM user group.
    - Attach policies to an IAM user group instead of an IAM user so that it apply to all users within the group.

- AWS IAM Roles
    - An IAM role is an IAM Identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.
    - An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS Identity with permission policies that determine what Identitycan and cannot do in AWS
    - However instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.
    - It doesn't have long term creds. When you assume a role, it provides you with temporary Security creds.
    Example: If a member from development team wants to work on testing a feature he built, instead of giving him all the permissions, I can assign testing role to him.
        - This will give him temporary access to testing resources.
