AWS DynamoDB

Features:
    - No SQL
    - Key:Value
    - Serverless database of Amazon

- It is designed to handle 10 trillion requests per day.
- Use case:
    - E-commerce application
    - Creating player profile pages
    - It can provide single digit(0-9) ms latency
    - When you create dynamoDB table:
        - Creating partition/primary key is mandatory
        - Represented as items -> collection of attributes
    - In DynamoDB, item size should not be greater than 400kB
    - If more than 400kB, store in s3 and put link in DynamoDB
    - Dynamo + cache -> DAX (Dynamo DB accelerator) 0-9 micro seconds latency
    - RCU -> Read capacity unit
        - Eventual consistency Read
        - Strong consistency Read
    - WCU -> Write capacity unit
        - For 1 WCU, 1kB of data
    Note: DynamoDB replicate data across 3 availability zones and takes 1000ms
        - AZ1, AZ2 and AZ3 are the 3 AZ
        - For eventual consistency:
            - Allows you to read from other replicas before write happens to each replica(get stale data)
            - Here, we don't care about correctness of data for a latency of 1sec
            Ex: Streaming match
            - In 0.5 RCU, it can read 4 kB, or 8kB per 1 RCU
        - For strong consistency: 
            - Doesn't allow you to read from other AZ until data is replicated throughout all replicas
            - Ex: Booking systems, financial transactions
            - They are usually slow. In one RCU, we can read only 4KB of data

    - DynamoDB is good for read purpose:
    Ex: E-Commerce
