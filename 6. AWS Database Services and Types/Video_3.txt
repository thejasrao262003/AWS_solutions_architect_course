AWS Database Caching Strategy

i) Lazy loading: We don't want to fetch frequently accessed data from memory always. So instead, we store it in cache to be able to fetch it easily and quickly
- Disadvantages:
    - Each cache will have a TTL. If TTL is 30 mins, the data won't change till 2:30. 
    - So in case data changes in database, for 30 mins, the change won't be shown.
    - This will give rise to discrepency

ii) Write through: Changes made in database, will be made in cache as well.

- Eviction strategy:
    - FIFO
    - LFU
    - LRU
