AWS Relational Database(RDS)
- It is often called as tabled data
- Data is always stored with fixed schema in the form of rows and columns
- The different types of SQL commands are:
    - DDL: create, alter, drop etc
    - DML: insert, update, delete etc
    - DQL: select
    - DCL: grant, revoke etc
    - TCL: commit, rollback etc
- The relational database schemas are fixed.

The different relational databases are:
- Aurora
- MySQL
- Postgre
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL server
- IBM DB2

Note: Aurora->  (Cloud database) and it is Amazon propreitary, serverless
            - Compatible with MySQL, Postgre
            - 5x faster than MySQL, 3x faster than Postgre
            - Creates 6 copies in 3 availability Zones
            - Creates 15 read replica and update in each replicas in 10ms

RDS Multi AZ Deployment:
    - Deploy database in multiple Availability zones.
    - So one is for write. The other ones just synchronise data and act as fault tolerant systems
    - If the primary DB fails, the stand by will change to primary and once the old primary db is up, that is made the new stand by

AWS RDS Read replicas:
    - Creates multiple read replicas to handle load.
    - The updates to read replicas happen asynchronously.
    - That is, there will be a delay for the new data to be shown in the read replicas(within 10ms)
    - Stale data for few milliseconds
    - Burstable classes have ability to take more stress
