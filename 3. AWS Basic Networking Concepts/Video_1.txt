IP Addressing and Classless Interdomain Routing(CIDR)

192.168.0.0/16 -> What is this?
How many IP address can we create?

192.168.0.0 -> 32 bits

So 192.168.0.0/24 -> This means 24 bits are blocked. So 2^8 -> 256 IPs can be created

In this 2 IPs are blocked. So 2^(32-n) - 2
i) First one is reserved for network -> 192.168.0.0
ii) Last one is reserved for broadcast -> 192.168.0.255

In AWS we reserve 5 IPs:
- First one is reserved for network -> 192.168.0.0
- second one is reserved for Route -> 192.168.0.1
- Third one is reserved for DNS -> 192.168.0.2
- Fourth one is reserved for Future -> 192.168.0.3
- Last one is reserved for broadcast -> 192.168.0.255

Therefore total number of IPs that can be created are 2^(32-n)-5
