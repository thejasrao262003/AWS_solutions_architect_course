NACL – Network Access Control List
    - Acts as a subnet-level firewall
    - Controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet boundary
    - Stateless – return traffic must be explicitly allowed
    - Can have both Allow and Deny rules
    - Rules are evaluated in order, from lowest to highest rule number
    - Typical use: Block or allow specific IP ranges or ports across the entire subnet

Security Group (SG)
    - Acts as an instance-level firewall
    - Controls who can access an EC2 instance and on which ports
    - Stateful – if you allow inbound traffic, return traffic is automatically allowed
    - Only allows Allow rules (no deny)
    - All rules are evaluated together (not by order)
    - Typical use: Allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), etc., to specific EC2 instances
