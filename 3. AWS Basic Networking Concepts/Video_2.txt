Virtual Private Cloud(Subnet, Internet Gateway and Route Table)

VPC:
    - With Amazon VPC, you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined.
    - This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using scalable infrastructure of AWS

    First we create VPC, then we create resources
    Analogy: We first buy a land and then build a house on that piece of land.
    - Even in home, you would want one room to be personal room, the other one can be guest room
    - When we create a room in VPC, it is called subnet.
    - Personal room is Private subnet, and Guest room is public subnet

Internet Gateway:
    - The internet gateway will be attached to VPC and inform public subnet, that you can go via internet gateway.
    - Attach the route table to subnet
Route table:
    - Refer to route_table.png image.
    The route table for public VPC will have two entries. One is normal target and Destination
    - The other is Internet Gateway to 0.0.0.0/0
     The route table for private VPC will have only one entry. That is target to destination.
