Local Zones, Wavelength Zones and Edge Locations

Important for low latency

Local Zones:
    - If we stick to Availability Zones, there will be latency in other parts of the world.
    For example: The Region is in Mumbai. What about people in Gurgaon?
    - This will create a lot of latency
    - So AWS started coming up with local zones(small data centers) with limited services like EC2, VPC, RDS, ECS, EKS etc
    - Created one in Delhi and one in Kolkata
    - 2 are coming soon. One in Chennai and one in Bangalore


Wavelength Zones:
    - AWS Wavelength enables developers to build applications that deliver ultra-low latencies to mobile devices and end users.
    - So a delay of 90-180 milliseconds is a lot for time critical application like Autonomous driving cars, medical image screening etc.
    - So what AWS started doing is deploying their infra on data center of communication service provider like Airtel, Vodafone etc

    So the previous flow: client -> mobile tower -> CSP(communication service provider)-> AWS region. This takes 90-180 milliseconds
    - On the other hand, with wavelength zones, the flow is: client -> mobile tower -> CSP. This takes very less time compared to sending it to regions.

Edge Location: 
    - They are the caching sites. Used for faster retreival.
    - They are not very updated, but very low latency.
    - CloudFront is a service that uses these edge locations to store data in cache.
